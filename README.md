### DOM manipulation project from The Odin Project's Web development 101 course

## Thoughts before starting

As I have stated before, I feel like DOM manipulation is one of my weakest suites, and, as such, I assume that this project is gonna kick my ass.

That does not mean that I'm not excited about it, but rather that I'm cautiousy optimistic.

I read through the steps before doing anything, and it doesn't really seem like that much of a complicated assignment, but in all honesty, a lot of these things don't really seem like a lot of work at face value but turn out to be a veritable nightmare when it comes to actually planning it and making it work.

Also, I finally found out about the basics of .md markup, so, expect all my files to be at least a little more presentable.

## Thougths after finishing 

Third time writing this because I cannot use vim to save my life.

I'll be brief this time because fuck it, writing this shit is so much of a fucking struggle since I've been mid-switch to Dvorak layout and while I like it, it's a hassle to fight the goddamned QWERTY muscle memory.

I learned that you have to manually size parent nodes vertically in order to have the children have a percentile size, sounds freaking obvious now, but hey, that's learning for ya.

wanted to add an hsl fade in from white to color to black, but couldn't work it out because I don't quite know yet how to parse string data, maybe I can come back to this after playing with RegEx for a while?

Also checked out some of the other students' projects for inspiration and tip searching, I was impressed by the things other students made! It really enlightened me in the fact that there's a lot to learn.

But it's a process, and it would be unfair of me to demand myself to be good at this in this stage, learning is a process and patience is a basic element of all processes in life.
