### DOM manipulation project from The Odin Project's Web development 101 course

## Thoughts before starting

As I have stated before, I feel like DOM manipulation is one of my weakest suites, and, as such, I assume that this project is gonna kick my ass.

That does not mean that I'm not excited about it, but rather that I'm cautiousy optimistic.

I read through the steps before doing anything, and it doesn't really seem like that much of a complicated assignment, but in all honesty, a lot of these things don't really seem like a lot of work at face value but turn out to be a veritable nightmare when it comes to actually planning it and making it work.

Also, I finally found out about the basics of .md markup, so, expect all my files to be at least a little more presentable.
